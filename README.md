# VRExperiment
A repository for the unity implementation of a psychological experiment in VR.

## Brief experiment description
When searching for something, humans may apply different strategies. The aim of our experiment is to find some of the patterns used in a structered search task. Additionally we want to analyze whether the complexity of the search task affects what patterns are used.

The task implemented in this repository is to find the letter W placed on one of 4 surrounding walls, which are filled with the letters M. 
We take the user's left controller, and use the primary and secondary thumb buttons to switch between the easy or hard scene (fewer or more letters M), and then press the trigger to start the experiment.
The user searches for the letter W, and their head rotation is tracked and logged onto the user's standalone HMD or computer. When the user finds the letter W they look at it and press the right trigger, finishing the search and stopping head logging.

## Results
Some images and results of our experiment can be found in [this presentation](./presentation.pdf). The experiment was performed on 15 participants, each performing 2 easy and 2 hard search tasks.
